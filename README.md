# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Your Task

This project will give me nightmares. This is the first time I have programmed any code and it was an extremely difficult task, I booked a tutoring session for tomorrow and will be studying Javascript 24/7. I was frankly lost and confused the entire time, this is extremely new to me. Saying this is not an excuse I just don't want whoever is grading this to think I thought it was acceptable to hand in, however, something is better than nothing. 

Sorry again.
